#### Description: 

This is a website which works as a forum. So you can post something and others can see your post as well as comment and like your post. 
This website is built using python and flask. For styling I've used bootstrap 5. 

So to run this project you need to have the latest pip version on your computer. 
then run the following command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following command:

```
python app.py
```
Then follow this link:

That's it!
